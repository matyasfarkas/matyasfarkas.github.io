I am an Economist in the Monetary Policy Strategy Division, Strategy Issues section of the European Central Bank. My research focuses on expectation formation, monetary policy and DSGE estimation.

I was part of the development team for [Macroecomomic Model Data Base](https://www.macromodelbase.com/), a Dyanre based macroeconomic model comparison platform.
