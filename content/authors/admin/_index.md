I am an Economist in the Monetary Policy Strategy Division, Strategy Issues section of the European Central Bank. My research focuses on how expectation formation affects monetary policy and practical questions of DSGE estimation.

I was part of the development team for [Macroecomomic Model Data Base](https://www.macromodelbase.com/). An Dyanre based macroeconomic model comparison platform.
